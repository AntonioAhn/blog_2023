I got this from April Watt. First one i tired. 

[moqueca](https://www.feastingathome.com/brazilian-fish-stew-aka-moqueca/)


# Ingredients:

- White fish- Halibut, Black Cod, Sea Bass , Cod, escolar, etc.  (thicker cuts are best)
- Dende â€“ Brazillian Red Palm oil ( or coconut oil)( i didn't end up using this, couldn't find it in store)
- onion 
- carrots
- red capsicum
- garlic
- chili peppers
- tomato paste (for got this)
- spices (paprika and cumin)
- chicken stock (used 2x small cubes, have to add hot water to dissolve)
- Tomatoes (diced)
- coconut milk (got a can, 400 mLs ? check)
- Lime (1 lime)

# Steps:

- dice everything except the fish. Fish is prepared thicker cuts

1. Season fish with lime + salt. Leave. 
2. In sauce-pan, olive-oil, onion, salt, heat. 2-3mins
3. Turn heat down to medium, add carrot, bell pepper and garlic. Cook 4-5 more minutes.
4. Add tomato paste (didn't use this, forgot), spices and stock.
5. Mix and bring to a simmer and add tomatoes. Cover and simmer gently on medium-low for 5 minutes or until carrots are tender.
6. Add the coconut milk and taste and add more salt if necessary.
7. Nestle the fish in the flavorful coconut stew, pouring the remaining marinade over the fish and into the stew, and either continue cooking stovetop, spooning the flavorful liquid over the fish for about 3-5 minutes ( until the desired doneness)  or for thicker cuts, place in a 350F oven, for 8-10 minutes.
8. Once done, the Moqueca will have thickened beautifully. Mine didn't thicken so it was more like soup. but it tasted great!
